## About

**tippy** is a python package and tool to access collection of my tips. I come across many new information in different streams of work and personal projects everyday. They come in many different forms - language syntax, commands, shortcuts, scripts, keyboard shortcuts, macros, new tools & scripts, subject internals, APIs, productivity hacks and so on. Sometimes I make a mental note of them and sometimes in my notebook or journal. Noting down in a journal helps to retain the information much stronger than simply taking a mental note. That also fades over time if I don't revisit specific section in the notes. I wanted a way better way to keep a collection of information and make them more visible in the places I frequent in my virtual environment. For e.g. I use certain scripts almost 20-30 times a day. I could plugin the tip tool to show me a new tip every time I run the script. I can have a webapp showing selected tips from the db. I can have an browser or vscode extension to show a tip at configured intervals. The more it stays in my visible range, better the chances of retaining the knowledge and be more efficient.

Just getting started with the tool. Planning to add more features to the tool, package and the additional tips going forward.
